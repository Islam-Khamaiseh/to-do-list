# To-Do List Application

This is a basic yet useful To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks effectively.

## Features :sparkles:

- *Add Tasks:* Simply type your task and hit the 'add' button to include it in your list.
- *Mark Tasks as Complete:* Once you finish a task, check it off. The task will be struck through indicating its completion.
- *Edit Tasks:* Need to make changes to existing tasks? No problem! Just hit the 'edit' button.
- *Delete Tasks:* Tasks can be removed individually. Moreover, you can use the 'clear done' button to get rid of all completed tasks or use 'clear all' to wipe your list clean.

## Code Structure :file_folder:

The application comprises three main files:

- *HTML (`index.html`):* Contains the structure of the app, including input fields, task list, and function buttons.
